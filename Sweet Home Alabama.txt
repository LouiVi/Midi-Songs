They got loose to you
Here it comes
Oh, whoa-whoa
Big wheels keep on turnin'
Carry me home to see my kin
Singin' songs about the Southland
I miss Alabamy once again, and I think it's a sin, I said
Well, I heard Mr. Young sing about her
Well, I heard old Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around, anyhow
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm comin' home to you
One thing I wanna tell you
In Birmingham, they love the governor (boo, boo, boo!)
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me, uh-uh
Does your conscience bother you? Tell the truth
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama (oh, my baby)
Lord, I'm comin' home to you (here I come, Alabama)
Speak your mind
Ah-ah-ah (can you feel that?), Alabama
Ah-ah-ah, Alabama
Ah-ah-ah, Alabama
Ah-ah-ah, Alabama
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two (yes, they do)
Lord, they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feelin' blue, now how 'bout you?
Sweet home Alabama (oh)
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm comin' home to you
Sweet home Alabama (home, sweet home, baby)
Where the skies are so blue (and the governor's, too)
Sweet home Alabama (Lord, yeah)
Lord, I'm comin' home to you (whoo, whoa, yeah, oh)
Alright, brother, now
Wait one minute
Oh-oh, sweet Alabama
Thank you
